  more information.

* Please see the new section in HACKING `Building after a git pull',
  as it contains information on how to workaround a little defect in
  the Jitter sub-pakaging mode that makes it not working well with the
  Automake maintainer-mode rules.

  out a stack trace.  This is useful to debug the compiler.

  bootstrap --no-git --gnulib-srcdir=DIR --jitter-srcdir=DIR.

  useful maintainer targets.  See HACKING.

2020-10-28
* libpoke is now built with all symbols hidden by default.  Public symbols
  in libpoke.h are explicitly marked as such.
