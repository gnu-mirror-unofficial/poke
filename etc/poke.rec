Summary: Optimise code by improving the PVM and the compiler
Component: PVM
Priority: 5
Kind: OPT
Description: Generate better code, branching to raise instructions
+ instead of using complex instructions containing PVM_RAISE inside.
+ This will improve code size and locality, also reducing the number
+ of taken branches.
+ A promising way to achieve this is with Jitter "subsections": ask

Summary: struct patterns and matching operators
Component: Language
Kind: ENH
Priority: 2
Description:
+    Foo {{ a == 2 }}
+
+ Only valid as second argument of the match operator ~.  NO: valid
+ everywhere, so the resulting closure can be passed to
+ commands/functions.  The pattern compiles to a closure, that is then
+ called.
+
+    (poke) Foo { a = 2} ~ Foo {{ a == 2 }}
+    1
+
+ Or:
+
+     Foo {{a ==2}} (Foo { a = 2 })
+
+    TYPE {{ EXP, EXP, ... }}
+
+ Where EXP is an expression that evaluates to an int<32>.  All the
+ expressions should evaluate to 1 when applied to the given struct
+ value, for the pattern operator to succeed.
+
+ ~ can also be used with: STRING ~ STRING where the second string
+ contains a regular expression.
+
+ This will lead to write the `search' command.
+
+ 18:27 <bhaible> so does it return a Packet, or does it return a
+                 boolean, or throw an exception?
+ 18:28 <jemarch> Packet {{ i > 0 }} (mypacket)
+ 18:28 <jemarch> the function returns a boolean
+ 18:28 <jemarch> if (Packet {{ i > 0 }} (mypacket)) ...
+ 18:28 <jemarch> Then I am considering adding a "match" operator ~
+ 18:29 <jemarch> which gets as operands a struct value, and a
+                 function with signature (TYPE_NAME s) INT
+ 18:29 <jemarch> so you can write:
+ 18:29 <jemarch> if (mypacket ~ Packet {{ i > 0 }}) ...
+ 18:29 <jemarch> which looks more natural
+ 18:29 <jemarch> still having the patterns to evaluate to a function
+                 is useful, because you can pass it around without
+                 having to define a new value class "pattern"
+ 18:30 <bhaible> and you will want cascaded matches to be useable in
+                 a 'switch' statement too, is that it?
+ 18:31 <jemarch> right :)
+ 18:31 <jemarch> case Packet {{ ... }}:
+ 18:31 <jemarch> case Packet {{ ... }}:
+
+ 18:37 <bhaible> I mean    ID3V1_Tag {{ get_year() == 2018 }}
+ 18:37 <jemarch> you cant
+ 18:37 <jemarch> but you don't need a pattern for that
+ 18:38 <jemarch> astruct ~ ID3V1_Tag {{ ...other expr... }} &&
+                 astruct.get_year () == 2018
+ 18:38 <bhaible> But that's where the pattern as a synonym for "type
+                 with certain conditions" would be useful
+ 18:38 <jemarch> yes but the methods are not fields
+ 18:39 <bhaible> If inside the {{ ... }} I can access the fields
+                 without a prefix, I should also be able to invoke
+                 the methods without a prefix.
+ 18:39 <jemarch> that can be arranged
+
+ Or using lambdas:
+
+ lambda (TYPE s) int: { return EXP && ...; }
+
+ NO.
+
+ This better, which is not ambiguous:
+
+         | pushlevel '{' TYPENAME '|' expression_list '}'
+                 {
+                   $$ = NULL;
+                 }

Description:
+ We want to add a new language construction ``format``, which has the
+ form:

+   format (FMT, ARGS...)
+
+ or:
+
+   format FMT, ARGS...
+
+ ``format`` works like printf, but instead of printing out the

+ this construction to the compiler.  In principle no PVM changes are
+ necessary.
+

Summary: Introduce SELF in methods
Component: Language
Kind: ENH
Priority: 3
Description:
+ Poke methods can refer to the fields of the enclosing struct type like
+ if they were regular variables:
+
+   struct
+   {
+     byte a;
+
+     method set_a = (byte v) void:
+     {
+       a = v;
+     }
+   }
+
+ The refernce to `v' really means a sref to the struct value implicitly
+ passed as the first argument to the method.  This is useful and
+ convenient.  However, sometimes it is useful to access to the
+ properties of the struct, like its size, and for that it is necessary
+ to add a SELF:
+
+   method size = void:
+   {
+     return SELF'size;
+   }
+
+ The type of SELF would be `any' (since we do not support recursive
+ definitions) and the keyword SELF would only be available in method
+ bodies.  Ideally it wouldn't be a keyword anywhere else: maybe that is
+ achievable by piggybacking into the lexer.
+
+ Is `SELF' the right keyword to use?  Using uppercase reduces the odds
+ of collision with user defined identifiers.

Summary: Support nested integral structs

Kind: ENH
Priority: 4
Description:
+ This will require to subpass on fields.  i.e. a gen context:

Summary: Support for optional fields in integral structs
Component: Language
Kind: ENH
Priority: 3
Description:
+ At the moment optional fields are not supported in integral structs.
+ In particular, the lack of support is in the writer in
+ pkl-gen.pks:struct_field_writer.
+
+ The struct writer uses the following strategy to poke integral
+ structs:
+
+   Initialize IVAL to 0
+   FOR each field
+     IF field is not absent
+       IVAL |= FIELD_VALUE << SHIFT;
+   POKE IVAL to the corresponding offset
+
+ The problem with this approach is that if a field is not absent, the
+ portion in IVAL corresponding to its value is 0, and not the value
+ that currently exists in that portion in IO space.
+
+ Fixing this probably involves:
+ 1. Initializing IVAL to the current contents in IO space instead of 0.
+ 2. hacking ``struct_field_inserter`` in order to zero the portion of
+    the field in IVAL before inserting it.
+
+ Once support is ready in ``struct_writer`` the compile-time check
+ forbiding optional fields in ``pkl_typify1_ps_type_struct`` should be
+ removed accordingly.

Summary: Make endianness a type quality

Priority: 2
Description:
+ To: Bruno Haible <bruno@clisp.org>

+ Subject: Re: Generalizing the big/little attribute
+ From: "Jose E. Marchesi" <jemarch@gnu.org>
+ Gcc: nnfolder+archive:sent.2020-07
+ --text follows this line--
+
+ Hi Bruno!
+ Sorry for the delay in replying to this.
+
+ First of all, thank you very much for your suggestions.  There is a lot
+ to improve/complete in Poke's design!  Much appreciated :)
+
+     Currently, big/little applies only integral struct fields:
+
+     deftype test =
+       struct
+       {
+         little uint32 a;                        // OK
+         little uint8[3] b;                      // ERROR
+         little struct { uint8 x; uint8 y; } c;  // ERROR
+       };
+
+     A simple generalization to make it apply to integral types, then
+
+     deftype test =
+       struct
+       {
+         little uint32 a;                        // OK
+         little uint8[3] b;                      // would be OK
+         little struct { uint8 x; uint8 y; } c;  // ERROR
+       };
+
+     However, another generalization would be more powerful:
+     [...]
+
+ The big/little attribute, as you mention, is currently associated with
+ struct fields.  It is not associated with integral types.  Implementing
+ the "simple generalization" would involve adding a new attribute to
+ struct types, with the endianness to use.  This would be easy.
+
+ However, at this point I would generalize the endianness in a way it
+ becomes an attribute of certain types, not struct fields.  This way, you
+ could write:
+
+ deftype MSBInt32 = big int<32>;
+ deftype Foo = little struct { MSBInt32 magic_in_big; ... };
+
+ This would involve changes in the type system (like, two integer types
+ with different endianness are different types) but I don't think it will
+ require a lot of work.
+
+     So, in any place where you can use a type name, you could also add a
+     little/big attribute, and it has a recursive effect.
+
+ Using the approach of associating endianness to types, it would be
+ natural to support a new type specifier `{little,big} typename', that
+ constructs a proper (derived) type itself.
+
+ Then we could use `{little,big} typename' anywhere a type specifier is
+ expected, like casts, function formal arguments, etc.
+
+     Method invocations would not only have an implicit SELF argument, but
+     maybe also an implicit ENDIANNESS_OVERRIDE argument?
+
+ Good idea

Summary: Support for big numbers
Component: Language
Kind: ENH
Priority: 2
Description: Currently the PVM supports the following kind of integer values:
+

+      These values are unboxed.
+    Long integers, up to 64-bit, signed and unsigned
+      These values are boxed.
+
+ The task is to introduce an additional kind of integer:
+
+    Big integers, up to infinite bits, signed and unsigned
+     These values are boxed.
+
+ This new integer shall be implemented as a boxed value, using the GNU
+ MultiPrecision library ``libgmp``.  This task involves:
+
+ - Adding the support to ``src/pvm-val.[ch]``.
+ - Add new instruction to ``src/pvm.jitter``, i.e. itob, btol, etc.
+ - Adapt the compiler to support big integer literals.

Component: PVM
Kind: ENH
Priority: 3
Description:
+ Foo { ... } (IVAL)

Summary: remove unneeded locs in the passes/phases
Component: Compiler
Kind: ENH
Priority: 3
Description:
+ In the past we used to force having location information for all nodes
+ in the AST.  This would assure that a location was always available
+ when printing error messages involving these nodes.  However, this
+ leads on a miriad of locations that are simply not useful, so we
+ removed the check.
+
+ This task is about:
+ 1) Identifying which LOCs are not needed, and remove them, and
+ 2) Emit an ICE if no location is found at error/warning emission time.
+
+ This will hopefully lead to have the minimum set of locations that is
+ actually needed.

Summary: unify `break' and `continue' in the same AST node
Component: Compiler

+ field (kind = break | continue).

+ optimized: pkl_asm_break_label_1 vs. pkl_asm_continue_label_1.

Summary: Support lazy mapping
Component: PVM
Kind: ENH
Priority: 2
Description:
+ In complete arrays, the size of the elements is known at compile-time.
+ Then, it is not required to calculate it by peeking the element from
+ IO.  Lazy mapping is therefore possible.
+
+ Size annotations will be needed in structs in cases where it is not
+ possible for the compiler to determine the size by:
+
+   struct size(24#B) { ... }
+
+ Because of data integrity, lazy mapping can only be done when mapping
+ non-strict values.

+
+     No objections and it is indeed a nice improvement.
+
+ I just had an idea.
+
+ It would be awesome if you would generate a terminal hyperlink on the
+ `TypeName {...}' part, that would generate an `e' command to evaluate
+ the field.  This would make using the tree shallow mode very comfy!
+
+ Example:
+
+ (poke) .file foo.o
+ (poke) load elf
+ (poke) .set tree-print shallow
+ (poke) Elf64_Ehdr @ 0#B
+ Elf64_Ehdr {
+    e_ident=struct {...},
+            ------------
+    e_type=0x1UH,
+    e_machine=0x3eUH,
+    e_version=0x1U,
+    e_entry=0x0UL#B,
+    e_phoff=0x0UL#B,
+    e_shoff=0x208UL#B,
+    e_flags=0x0U,
+    e_ehsize=0x40UH#B,
+    e_phentsize=0x0UH#B,
+    e_phnum=0x0UH,
+    e_shentsize=0x40UH#B,
+    e_shnum=0xbUH,
+    e_shstrndx=0xaUH
+  }
+
+ Above, the ---- underlines the hyperlink that would be generated in the
+ terminal.  Then, when the user clicks it, it will execute:
+
+ (poke) (Elf64_Ehdr @ 0#B).e_ident
+ struct {
+    ei_mag=[0x7fUB,0x45UB,0x4cUB,0x46UB],
+    ei_class=0x2UB,
+    ei_data=0x1UB,

Summary: Make the PVM aware of units
Component: PVM
Kind: ENH
Priority: 3
Description:
+ The poke compiler allows the user to define her own units using the
+ ``unit`` construct.  The PVM, however, is oblivious of this, and it
+ only knows how to print the names of the standard units.  This is
+ achieved by replicating the logic of the units in the
+ ``print_unit_name`` function.
+
+ We really want to make the PVM aware of units.  This would allow us to:
+
+ 1. Print the name of user-defined units when printing offsets.
+
+ 2. Avoid logic replication in ``print_unit_name`` and the set of

Summary: Support Poke IOS Translators
Component: IO
Kind: ENH
Priority: 2
Description:
+ This requires support for specifying method implementations in struct
+ constructors.
+
+ The goal of this project is to being able to "translate" an IO space
+ using Poke code.  Example:
+
+   var my_translator
+     = IOS_Translate { readp = my_readp, writep = my_writep ... };
+
+   var outer = open ("disk.img");
+   var inner = translate (outer, my_translator);
+
+ In this scenario, the methods in ``my_translator`` are invoked when IO
+ mapping is performed in ``inner``::
+
+   int @ inner : 0#B -> calls my_read
+
+ When the methods in ``my_translator`` run, the current IOS is ``outer``.
+
+ The ``IOS_Translate`` type shall be defined in ``std.pk`` and
+ basically implements the IOD interface in ``ios-dev.h`:
+
+   type IOS_Translate =
+    struct
+    {
+      type IOS_ReadFunc = ...;
+      type IOS_WriteFunc = ...;
+
+      IOS_ReadFunc readp = ...;
+      IOS_WriteFunc writep = ...;
+    };
+
+ This of course depends on support for setting methods in struct
+ constructors.

+ - ditto for the *move functions.
+ - ditto for the *mbsnlen functions.
+ - ditto for *next and *prev.
+ - ditto for *strlen.
+ - Comparison functions are useful (for sorting for example.)

Summary: add mutex to avoid concurrency crash with hyperlinks
Component: POKE
Kind: ENH
Priority: 4
Description: 
+ Until we figure out how to implement concurrency in Poke, we have to
+ avoid running nested PVMs, which happens easily with hyperlinks:
+ 
+   hserver_print_hl ('i', "crashme", "", lambda void: { print "die\n"; });
+   print "\n";
+ 
+   while (1)
+     {
+       print ("looping peacefully...");
+       sleep (1);
+     }
+ 
+ Jitter detects this and gives an error.  We need a mutex to protect
+ the PVM, and make the hserver and the prompt to use it.

Summary: support casts from `any' to function types
Kind: ENH
Component: Compiler
Component: PVM
Priority: 3
Description: 
+ Right now we are not allowing casting from `any' to a function type.
+ Supporting this requires to tag the PVM closure values with their
+ corresponding type.
