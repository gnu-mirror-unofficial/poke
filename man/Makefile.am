##  Depend on the source, not the binary; we don't need to regenerate
##  the binary when any source file changes, only the main one.
# However, there is no guarantee that the binary will exist, so dependence
# on the source is appropriate, and help2man is cheap anyway.

# Use -o so that the `missing' program can infer the output file.
