# We do some changes in the .html files generated by makeinfo:
#
# - The "Table of Contents" in poke.html/index.html is not emitted.
#   This is because the Top node also provides a table of contents,
#   that is much more informative.
#
# - makeinfo generates an <h3> for footnote marks (N).  This looks
#   like a bug, since the "Footnotes" heading is <h4> itself.  Using a
#   header for this is ugly anyway.
