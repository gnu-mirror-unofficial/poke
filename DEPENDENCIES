The following packages should be installed before GNU poke is installed
(runtime dependencies that are also build dependencies):

* Boehm GC
  + Mandatory.
    Poke uses the Boehm conservative garbage collector for managing the
    memory of some of its subsystems.
  + Homepage:
    https://www.hboehm.info/gc/
  + Download:
    https://www.hboehm.info/gc/gc_source/
  + Pre-built package name:
    - On Debian and Debian-based systems: libgc-dev,
    - On Red Hat distributions: gc-devel.
    - Other: https://repology.org/project/boehm-gc/versions

  + Note that if you have the Boehm GC installed in a prefix different
    from the one that contains pkg-config, you either need to set
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH so that pkg-config finds it:

    $ test -z "$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" \
        || PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX_OF_PKGCONFIG}/lib/pkgconfig
    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX_OF_LIBGC}/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}

    or set the variables BDW_GC_CFLAGS, BDW_GC_LIBS when invoking 'configure'.

    Which one to use, depends how the Boehm GC is installed:
    - If it is installed as a binary package from the vendor, you usually
      don't need to set any variable.
      Except on Solaris 11, where you have to set BDW_GC_LIBS="-lbgc".
    - If it is installed as a binary package in /usr/local, such as e.g. on
      FreeBSD, set
      BDW_GC_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" BDW_GC_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -lgc"
    - If it is installed from source with the same --prefix as you are using
      for GNU poke, set
      BDW_GC_LIBS="-lgc"
    - If it is installed from source with a different --prefix, set
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH as shown above.

* GNU readline
  + Mandatory.
    Poke uses GNU libreadline in order to provide a nice line editor in
    the '(poke)' prompt.  Any recent version will suffice.
  + Homepage:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/readline/
  + Download:
    https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/
  + Pre-built package name:
    - On Debian and Debian-based systems: libreadline-dev,
    - On Red Hat distributions: readline-devel.
    - Other: https://repology.org/project/readline/versions
  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, pass the option
    --with-libreadline-prefix=DIR to 'configure'.

* JSON-C
  + Optional.
    The poke machine-interface uses a protocol to communicate with
    clients, which is based on JSON.  poke uses the json-c library to
    parse and build JSON strings.
    If this library is not found, poke will build without machine-interface
    support.
  + Homepage:
    https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki
  + Download:
    https://s3.amazonaws.com/json-c_releases/releases/index.html
  + Pre-built package name:
    - On Debian and Debian-based systems: libjson-c-dev,
    - On Red Hat distributions: json-c-devel.
    - Other: https://repology.org/project/json-c/versions
  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, you need to set
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH so that pkg-config finds it:

    $ test -z "$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" \
        || PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX_OF_PKGCONFIG}/lib/pkgconfig
    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX_OF_JSON_C}/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}

    or set the variables JSON_C_CFLAGS, JSON_C_LIBS when invoking 'configure'.

* Tcl and Tk
  + Optional.
    The poke GUI uses Tcl and Tk, so you need to have the respective
    development packages installed in your system.  Any recent version
    will suffice.
  + Homepage:
    https://www.tcl.tk/
  + Download:
    https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/download.html
  + Pre-built package name:
    - On Debian and Debian-based systems: tcl-dev, tk-dev,
    - On Red Hat distributions: tcl-devel, tk-devel.
    - Other: https://repology.org/project/tk/versions

* GNU libtextstyle
  + Optional.
    GNU poke uses libtextstyle in order to provide styled output.  If the
    library is not found, then a dummy version of it from gnulib is used
    instead... that does not do any styling!
  + Homepage:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/libtextstyle/manual/index.html
  + Download:
    At the moment libtextstyle lives in a subdirectory of GNU gettext.
    https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/
  + Pre-built package name:
    - On Debian and Debian-based systems: gettext (>= 0.21, in unstable),
    - On Red Hat distributions: --.
    - Other: https://repology.org/project/libtextstyle/versions
  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, pass the option
    --with-libtextstyle-prefix=DIR to 'configure'.

* libnbd
  + Optional.
    GNU poke optionally uses libnbd to expose an io space for data served
    by an arbitrary NBD (Network Block Device) server.  Testing this
    further requires nbdkit to quickly provide an arbitrary NBD server.
  + Homepage:
    http://libguestfs.org/libnbd.3.html
  + Download:
    https://download.libguestfs.org/libnbd/
  + Pre-built package name:
    - On Debian and Debian-based systems: libnbd-dev,
    - On Red Hat distributions: libnbd-devel, nbdkit-basic-plugins.
    - Other: https://repology.org/project/libnbd/versions
  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, you need to set
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH so that pkg-config finds it:

    $ test -z "$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" \
        || PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX_OF_PKGCONFIG}/lib/pkgconfig
    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX_OF_LIBNBD}/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}

    or set the variables LIBNBD_CFLAGS, LIBNBD_LIBS when invoking 'configure'.
