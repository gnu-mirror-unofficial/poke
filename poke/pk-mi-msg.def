/* This file contains the definitions of all the messages used by the
   poke Machine-Interface.

   Each message is defined using one of the following macros:

   PK_DEF_REQ defines a request.
   PK_DEF_RESP defines a response.
   PK_DEF_EVENT defines an event.

   In each entry:

   The first column is an identifier that univocally identifies the
   message in its category.

   The second column is the list of named arguments accepted by the
   message.  Each argument is characterized by a name and a PK value
   kind (integer, unsigned integer, string, array, etc) */
