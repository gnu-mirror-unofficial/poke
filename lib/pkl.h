/*** Compiler Services.  ***/

/* This is the main header file for the Poke Compiler.  The Poke
   Compiler is an "incremental compiler", i.e. it is designed to
   compile poke programs incrementally.

   A poke program is a sequence of declarations of several classes of
   entities, namely variables, types and functions, and statements.

   The PKL compiler works as follows:

   First, a compiler is created and initialized with `pkl_new'.  At
   this point, the internal program is almost empty, but not quite:
   part of the compiler is written in poke itself, and thus it needs
   to bootstrap itself defining some variables, types and functions,
   that compose the run-time environment.

   Then, subsequent calls to `pkl_compile_buffer' and
   `pkl_compile_file (..., PKL_PROGRAM, ...)' expands the
   internally-maintained program, with definitions of variables,
   types, function etc from the user.

   At any point, the user can request to compile a poke expression
   with `pkl_compile_expression'.  This returns a PVM program that,
   can be executed in a virtual machine.  It is up to the user to free
   the returned PVM program when it is not useful anymore.

   `pkl_compile_buffer', `pkl_compile_file' and
   `pkl_compile_expression' can be called any number of times, in any
   possible combination.

   Finally, `pkl_free' should be invoked when the compiler is no
   longer needed, in order to do some finalization tasks and free
   resources.  */
