GNU poke is an interactive, extensible editor for binary data.  Not
limited to editing basic entities such as bits and bytes, it provides
a full-fledged procedural, interactive programming language designed
to describe data structures and to operate on them.

If you are interested in helping in the development, please check out
the source code repository (see https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=poke)
and start by reading the file HACKING carefully.

This is a GNU program, developed by the GNU Project and part of the
GNU Operating System. If you are the author of an awesome program and
want to join us in writing free software, please consider making it an
official GNU program.  See http://www.gnu.org/help/evaluation for
instruction on how to do so, and thanks! :)
