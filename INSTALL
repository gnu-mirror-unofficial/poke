This file explains how to install GNU poke from a tarball.
(If you have checked out the source code repository, start by reading the
file HACKING instead.)


Prerequisites
=============

Before starting the installation, install the prerequisites listed in the
file DEPENDENCIES.  You need to have at least those marked as 'Mandatory'
installed.


Installation
============

Then, you can run 'configure':

  $ mkdir build/ && cd build
  $ ../configure

Here, you can give as arguments to 'configure'

  - configure options, as listen in the 'configure --help' output,
  - Makefile variable assignments for building the binaries, as
    described in the INSTALL.generic file.

If you are in a 64-bit multilib system with support for building 32-bit
binaries, you can build a 32-bit poke configuring like this:

  $ ../configure CC="gcc -m32"

You find a set of known-to-work variable settings for various platforms
in https://gitlab.com/ghwiki/gnow-how/-/wikis/Platforms/Configuration .

You can also pass to 'configure' Makefile variable assignments for building
the documentation.  For example, to get HTML documentation styled like the
"Applied Pokology" blog, use

  MAKEINFOFLAGS="--css-ref=http://www.jemarch.net/homepage.css"

Finally:

  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install


Building the GUI
================

The poke GUI is optional and it is built by default, provided the required
dependencies (see the file DEPENDENCIES) are found at configure time.

To disable building the GUI, pass the '--disable-gui' option at configure
time.
