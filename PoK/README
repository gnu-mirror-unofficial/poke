PoK - Proof of Koncept of a graphical interface for GNU poke.

PoK is a prototype that we use in order to explore the best ways for a
graphical tool to interact with poke.  It is also a good mean to make
sure that poke's machine interface (MI) is complete and effective.

It follows that eye-candy is not a priority for this prototype:
functionality prime.  If you want to write a proper graphical poke
editor, you are welcome to use PoK as a source of inspiration on what
kind of mechanisms and abstractions you want to provide, and on how
you can interact with poke via the MI.

Of course PoK may be useful to do some serious poking in a graphical
way, but if so, that's just by pure chance! ;)
