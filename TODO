GNU Poke - TODO lists
=====================

Copyright (C) 2019, 2020 Jose E. Marchesi
See the end of the file for license conditions.

NOTE: this file is not your typical abandoned TODO file that nobody
      reads and nobody updates.  We **do** use this file, and these
      are tasks that really need to get done.

If you start working on a complex task, please let us know in the
development mailing list so we can be aware of your efforts, and
probably help you.

If you complete a task, please include a patch for this file in your
patch submission, removing the corresponding entry.

Each TODO entry headline has a prefix that expresses certain
characteristics of the task.  The prefix starts with a #
character.

After the #, a single character identifies the domain of the task.
Valid value are:

B
  Build system.
D
  Documentation.
C
  Dot-commands, REPL and interface.
L
  The Poke language.
P
  The PKL compiler.
A
  The PKL compiler.  Frontend.
B
  The PKL compiler.  Backend.
M
  The Poke Virtual Machine.
R
  RAS, the retarded assembler.
I
  The IOS subsytem.


Then follows a single-digit number, which identifies the expected
difficulty of the task.  These are:

0
  Low Hanging Fruit.  Good for a bored rainy night while tired or a
  hangoverish lazy Sunday.
1
  Easy and localized task.
2
  Moderately complex task.  May involve hacking several parts of
  the program.
3
  Complex task.  Most probably planning is needed, splitting into
  other tasks, etc.

One of the following characters may follow the difficulty digit:

!
  Please ask in ``poke-devel`` before attacking this task.  It will
  require discussion.

All the headlines start exactly at the first column of a line.  This
makes it easy to grep this file for particular TODO entries.

Entries can contain a list of people working on that task.  If you
intend to pick an item from the list, please let us know in
``poke-devel`` so we can update the file.  Likewise, if you stop
working on a given task, please let us know!

For help on how to hack GNU poke, please see the file HACKING in this
same directory.

Happy poking!

#B0 Use jitter deopt options only where needed
----------------------------------------------

At the moment the JITTER_CFLAGS and friends are applied to all the
sources of the `poke' program.  As jitter does some deoptimizations,
it would be more efficient to use these flags only in jitter-generated
vm files.  This could be achieved using a libtool convenience library.

#C1 Make poke_interactive_p available to Poke programs
------------------------------------------------------

The global variable ``poke_interactive_p`` defined in ``src/poke.c``
tells whether poke is running interactively, i.e. if the standard
input and output are connected to a tty.

It would be useful to have this information available in Poke
programs, so they can alter their behavior accordingly.

Probably a good way to implement this is via a built-in and a
definition in ``pkl-rt.pk`` like::

  defun poke_interactive_p = int<32>: __PKL_BUILTIN_INTERACTIVE_P__;

#C3 Debugging mode in poke
--------------------------

Debug mode::

  (poke) .set debug 1

Also in the command line::
  
   $ poke --debug

Makes the compiler to generate location instructions, and generally
adapt to debug Poke programs.  This mode will probably be
significantly slower... that's ok.

#A1 Support for multiline strings with """
------------------------------------------

At some point we will support docstrings in Poke functions.  For that,
it is useful to support multi-line strings in order to avoid having to
terminate each line with ``\n\``.

We can use the python syntax """ ... """.  Other ideas are welcome.

This should be implemented in the lexer, ``src/pkl-lex.l``.

#P3! Locations in exceptions
----------------------------

The exception objects then shall be augmented in order to carry the
location information.  Something like::
  
  deftype Exception =
    struct
    {
      int code;
      string file;
      int line;
      int column;
    }

The ``raise`` instruction will install the current location in the
exception.

Then, the default exception handler ``_pkl_exception_handler`` in
``src/pkl-rt.pk`` shall be expanded to print the file, line and the
column, if present.

#M1 Negative encoding PVM instructions
--------------------------------------

At the moment the global negative encoding used by the ``peekd*`` and
``poked*`` instructions is controlled by the user via the dot-command
``.set``, for example::

  (poke) .set nenc 1c
  (poke) .set nenc 2c

We need to be able to set the negative encoding programmatically from
Poke programs.  As a first step, it is necessary to add a few
instructions to the PVM to update the global state.
Suggested instructions::

  popenc             # ( NENCODING -- )
  pushenc NENCODING  # ( -- NENCODING )

A suitable encoding NENCODING in an int<32> is trivial::

  0 - 2's complement
  1 - 1's complement

#M2! Location tracking in PVM
-----------------------------

The PVM shall be expanded with new instructions for location
tracking.  Something like::
  
  pushloc file,line,column
  setloc line,column
  poploc

If you want to work in this, please start a discussion in
``poke-devel`` so we can design a suitable set of instructions.


#R1 Validate the number of bits in u?int and u?long arguments
-------------------------------------------------------------

Currently RAS doesn't validate the number of bits used in PVM values.
For example, this is passed as valid::

  push ulong<100>23

RAS should emit an error in that case.

#L2 Support bitwise operators for offsets
-----------------------------------------

Offset values should support bitwise operations, in exactly the same
way than integer values::

  OFF1 ^ OFF2
  OFF1 & OFF2
  OFF1 | OFF2
  OFF1 <<. INT
  OFF1 .>> INT

This task involves modifying the relevant typify1 handlers to allow
offsets in these operators, promotion rules in promo and updates to
the code generator.  I suggest to implement the operations as
macro-instructions in ``src/pkl-asm.c``.

#L2 Support casts from/to integrals to strings
----------------------------------------------

This task is about supporting string-to-integer and integer-to-string
conversions as casts::

  10 as string -> "10"
  "10" as uint<32> -> 10U

Note that the string-to-integer cast can raise an E_conv exception if
it is not possible to convert the string to an integer value.

#L3! Support `big' integral values (>64 bit) with GMP
-----------------------------------------------------

Currently the PVM supports the following kind of integer values:

Integers up to 32-bit, signed and unsigned
  These values are unboxed.
Long integers, up to 64-bit, signed and unsigned
  These values are boxed.

The task is to introduce an additional kind of integer:

Big integers, up to infinite bits, signed and unsigned
  These values are boxed.

This new integer shall be implemented as a boxed value, using the GNU
MultiPrecision library ``libgmp``.  This task involves:

- Adding the support to ``src/pvm-val.[ch]``.
- Add new instruction to ``src/pvm.jitter``, i.e. itob, btol, etc.
- Adapt the compiler to support big integer literals.
- Adapt the code generator to use the new instructions.

#A2 fold array trims
--------------------

This task is about implementing constant folding for array trims.
This shall be implemented in a handler in ``src/pkl-fold.c``.

#A1 fold array casts
--------------------

This task is about implementing constant folding for casts of array
literals, like in::

  [1,2,3] as int[]

Note that the construction above is relatively common in Poke, since
that'st he only way to denote an array literal having an unbounded
type.

This should be implemented as a handler in ``src/pkl-fold.c``.


#A1 fold "isa" expressions
--------------------------

This task is about implementing constant folding of ``isa``
operations.  This should be implemented as a handler in
``src/pkl-fold.c``.

#A1 support %% in printf string literals
----------------------------------------

A new %-sequence shall be added to printf: %%.  This denotes a single
% in the formatted output.  The right place where to hack this is the
``pkl_trans1_ps_print_stmt`` handler in ``src/pkl-trans.c``.


#M1 make the PVM run-time environment aware of units
----------------------------------------------------

The poke compiler allows the user to define her own units using the
``defunit`` construct.  The PVM, however, is oblivious of this, and it
only knows how to print the names of the standard units.  This is
achieved by replicating the logic of the units in the
``print_unit_name`` function.

We really want to make the PVM aware of units.  This would allow us
to:

1. Print the name of user-defined units when printing offsets.

2. Avoid logic replication in ``print_unit_name`` and the set of
   ``PVM_VAL_OFF_UNIT_*`` constants defined in ``pvm-val.h``.
