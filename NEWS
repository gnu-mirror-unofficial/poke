 Version 1.4 (3 December 2021)
* User visible changes
  - Operating with arrays must be now much faster.
  - Some of the compiler diagnostics have been made more readable and
    helpful.
  - Limitations in the values of the odepth, oindent and oacutoff have
    been removed.
* Bug fixes
  - Several typos and errors have been fixed in the User Manual.
  - Fix some segfaults in printf "%v".
  - The map operator wasn't using the right IO space in some
    circumstances.  Now it does the right thing.

 Version 1.3 (5 June 2021)
* User visible changes
  - The `dump' command now remembers and re-uses the last used offset
    per IO space.  Before it was a global offset used for all IO
    spaces, which was very confusing.
  - The text accompanying constraint violation exceptions now indicate
    the type and the field whose constraint failed.
  - libpoke.h is now compatible with C++.
  - printf "%v" now gives valid literals for strings in all cases,
    even if they contain non-printable characters.  It uses
    hexadecimal escape sequences \xNN in that case.
* Bug fixes
  - We were overflowing the Boehm GC roots capacity under certain
    circumstances.  This has been fixed in this release.
  - Avoid leaking slots in the exceptions stack.
  - Fix struct printers to skip absent fields.
  - Other bug fixes.

 Version 1.2 (18 April 2021)
* User visible changes
  - The .file dot-command now supports a /c flag for creating new,
    empty files.
  - A new compiler built-in `ioflags' is available, that returns
    the flags of some given IO space.
  - Certain operations now raise a E_perm exception, instead of the
    more generic E_io.
  - A new kind of IO device is now supported: the `zero' IOD.
    Opening "<zero>" will result in an IO space covering the full
    64-bit byte range, that always returns zero on reads and that
    ignores writes.
  - Function values (closures) can now be compared at language-level.
    They are compared by pointer.
  - The compiler now rejects casts from `any' to function types
    instead of ICEing.
  - The `dump' command now doesn't try to print anything if the
    current IOS is not readable.
  - The `dump' command now prints ?? for "unknown" bytes, i.e. for bytes
    in addresses that are not readable in the underlying IO space.
  - The standard function `ltos' now gets an additional optional
    argument `base', that defaults to 10.
  - The `big' and `little' annotations can now be used in any struct
    type field, regardless of its type.
* Bug fixes
  - A very nasty performance bottleneck in pvm_array_insert has been
    fixed.
  - Fix the opening mode of write-only files when the user doesn't
    specify explicit flags in `open'.
  - Avoid spurious EOF exceptions when writing weird integers past
    the end of an IOS.
  - Fix method `value' in leb128.pk
  - Fix ICE while compiling for-statements with several declarations.
  - Properly print > 2^32 addresses in `dump'
  - Other minor fixes.
* Other changes
  - The JSON MI machinery has been rewriten and much improved.
  - More tests in several areas.

 Version 1.1 (21 March 2021)
* User visible changes
  - The IOS_F_TRUNCATE `open' flag has been removed.
  - Constraint expressions and initializers can be now
    used together in struct fields.
* Bug fixes
  - The infamous bug preventing poke work on 32-bit systems is now
    fixed.
  - Better handling of open modes in the file IOD.
  - Improve some translatable strings.
  - poke won't raise an exception when starting if HOME
    is not defined in the environment.
  - The compiler now emits an error if it sees un-map-able
    fields in a struct type.
  - Properly handle the absence of current IOS in the map command.
  - Install Emacs modes.
  - Portability fixes for:
    + Mac OS X 10.5.
    + GNU/Hurd.
    + Solaris 11 OpenIndiana.
    + AIX.
    + mingw.
* Manual
  - Relicensed to GPLv3+.
  - Expand section on struct methods.
  - New section on data padding and alignment.
  - Document the Emacs modes provided by poke.
  - Provide a recommended pokerc configuration for beginners.
  - Other minor fixes based on user feedback.

 Version 1.0 (26 February 2021)
