/* The following struct defines the payload of the code generation
   phase.

   COMPILER is the Pkl compiler driving the compilation.

   PASM and PASM2 are stacks of macro-assemblers.  Assemblers in PASM
   are used for assembling the main program, struct mappers, and
   functions.  Assemblers in PASM2 are used for compiling struct
   constructors.

   ENDIAN is the endianness to be used when mapping and writing
   integral types.

   CUR_PASM and CUR_PASM2 are the pointers to the top of PASM and
   PASM2, respectively.

   PROGRAM is the main PVM program being compiled.  When the phase is
   completed, the program is "finished" (in PVM parlance) and ready
   to be used.

   CONTEXT is an array implementing a stack of contexts.  Each context
   is a bitmap.  See hte PKL_GEN_CTX_* constants below for the
   significance of each bit.  The initial context is initialized to 0.

   CUR_CONTEXT is the index to CONTEXT and marks the top of the stack
   of contexts.  Initially 0.

   MAPPER_DEPTH and CONSTRUCTOR_DEPTH are used in the array mapper and
   constructor generation handlers.

   IN_FILE_P indicates whether the current source is a file, as
   opposed to stdin (i.e. as opposed of compiling a statement.)  */
