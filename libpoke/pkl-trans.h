/* The following struct defines the payload of the trans phases.

   ERRORS is the number of errors detected while running the phase.

   ADD_FRAMES is the number of frames to add to lexical addresses.
   This is used in transl.

   FUNCTIONS is a stack of PKL_AST_FUNC nodes.

   FUNCTION_BACK is a stack of integers, denoting the current lexical
   depth relative to the current function.

   NEXT_FUNCTION - 1 is the index for the enclosing function in
   FUNCTIONS.  NEXT_FUNCTION is 0 if not in a function.

   ENDIAN is a stack whose top indicates the endianness to be used
   when mapping and writing integral types.

   CUR_ENDIAN is the index to ENDIAN and marks the top of the stack of
   endianness.  Initially PKL_AST_ENDIAN_DFL.  */
