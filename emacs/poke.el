;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements a Emacs interface to GNU poke, the extensible
;; editor for structured binary data.
;;
;; It uses the poked (GNU poke daemon) in order to act as a set of
;; pokelets:
;;
;; poke-out
;;      connected to the poked output channel 1.
;; poke-cmd
;;      connected to the poked input channel 2.
;; poke-code
;;      connected to the poked input channel 3.
;; poke-vu
;;      connected to the poked output channel 2.
